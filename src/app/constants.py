         buying and selling pressure based on volume. It works by adding the day's
         volume to a cumulative total when the price closes higher, and subtracting
         the day's volume when the price closes lower. The idea behind OBV is that
         changes in volume often precede price movements, providing insights into
         potential trends. Traders use OBV to confirm trends or identify divergences
         between volume and price action, which can signal potential reversals.""",

         suggesting a potential reversal or correction, while an RSI below 30
