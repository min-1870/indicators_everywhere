         volume to a cumulative total when the price closes higher, and subtracting
         the day's volume when the price closes lower. The idea behind OBV is that
         changes in volume often precede price movements, providing insights into

         principle that when the closing price is closer to the high of the period, it

         low suggests distribution (selling pressure). The CMF oscillates between -1
