        'name': 'On-Balance Volume',
        'detail': "On-Balance Volume is a technical analysis indicator that measures buying and selling pressure based on volume. It works by adding the day's volume to a cumulative total when the price closes higher, and subtracting the day's volume when the price closes lower. The idea behind OBV is that changes in volume often precede price movements, providing insights into potential trends. Traders use OBV to confirm trends or identify divergences between volume and price action, which can signal potential reversals.",

    'rsi': {
        'name': 'Relative Strength Index',
        'detail': "The Relative Strength Index is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. An RSI above 70 is considered overbought, suggesting a potential reversal or correction, while an RSI below 30 is considered oversold, indicating a potential buying opportunity. RSI helps traders gauge the strength of a price trend and identify potential reversals.",

    'macd': {
        'name': 'Moving Average Convergence Divergence',
        'detail': "The Moving Average Convergence Divergence is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A 9-period EMA of the MACD line, called the 'signal line', is then plotted on top of the MACD line. MACD is used to identify potential buy and sell signals through crossovers, divergences, and overbought/oversold conditions.",
    },
    'bb': {
        'name': 'Bollinger Bands',
        'detail': "Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that consists of three lines: a simple moving average (SMA) in the middle, and two outer bands that are a specified number of standard deviations away from the SMA. The outer bands expand and contract based on market volatility, with wider bands indicating higher volatility and narrower bands indicating lower volatility. Bollinger Bands help traders identify overbought and oversold conditions, as well as potential breakout opportunities.",
    },
    'gdc': {
        'name': 'Golden/Death Cross',
        'detail': "The Golden Cross and Death Cross are popular technical indicators that use moving averages to signal potential market trends. A Golden Cross occurs when a short-term moving average (typically the 50-day SMA) crosses above a long-term moving average (typically the 200-day SMA), signaling a potential bullish trend. A Death Cross occurs when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, signaling a potential bearish trend. These crosses are often used to identify long-term trend changes.",
    },
    'so': {
        'name': 'Stochastic Oscillator',
        'detail': "The Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator that compares a security's closing price to its price range over a specific period of time. It consists of two lines: %K and %D. The %K line represents the current closing price relative to the price range, while the %D line is a moving average of the %K line. The Stochastic Oscillator ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought (above 80) and oversold (below 20) conditions, as well as potential price reversals when the lines cross.",
